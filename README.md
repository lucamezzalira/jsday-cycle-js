# Reactive Live London Tube trains status

This is a sample application made with Cycle JS for the JS Day 2016 (Verona - Italy)

This project is composed by the following branches:
* master -> contains a first implementation of the live train application created for the event
* mvi-implementation -> most updated branch and it contains a refactor of the main application with MVI (Model View Intent) architecture
